# arojam
A small game for AroJam in March 2022
Made with GB Studio

## TODO :
- [X] The card disappeared after I interact with it
- [ ] Witch emotes appear too high above their head
- [X] Could we have a visual hint on the counter that the player can interact with the witch through the counter? A mat of something?
- [X] Missing "idle left" sprite for the witch, resulting in the witch facing right instead of left when speaking to the friend

- [ ] Logo screen?

- [x] Title screen
- [x] Define controls
- [x] The friend is not animated when walking left in the first scene
- [x] Clean up the background of the first scene
- [x] Why are the gems on the right moving when we interact with them?
