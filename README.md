# arojam
A small game for AroJam in March 2022
Made with GB Studio

## TODO :
- [ ] Music plugin for sound effect management (detect what measure is played, mute channel depending on measure number, play sound effect)
- [ ] Main sound track
- [ ] Radio sound track
- [ ] Sound effects (love/shock/anger emotes, maybe something when interacting with objects in the shop, maybe a cat sound effect)
- [ ] Dialogue name tags or avatars
- [ ] MC avatar choices (? assets + prog)
- [ ] Popup image for the wedding anniversary card ( 1 asset + prog)

Bugs:
- [ ] Witch emotes appear too high above their head

Bonus:
- [ ] Ending-specific images for fade out screen at the end (8 assets + prog)
- [ ] Adding a tarot deck object in the shop (assets and interaction to be determined)
- [ ] Accompanying song
- [ ] Logo screen

- [x] Title screen
- [x] Define controls
- [x] The friend is not animated when walking left in the first scene
- [x] Clean up the background of the first scene
- [x] Why are the gems on the right moving when we interact with them?
- [X] The card disappeared after I interact with it
- [X] Could we have a visual hint on the counter that the player can interact with the witch through the counter? A mat of something?
- [X] Missing "idle left" sprite for the witch, resulting in the witch facing right instead of left when speaking to the friend
