# arojam
A small game for AroJam in March 2022
Made with GB Studio

## TODO :
- [ ] The card disappeared after I interact with it
- [ ] Witch emotes appear too high above their head
- [ ] Could we have a visual hint on the counter that the player can interact with the witch through the counter? A mat of something?
- [ ] Missing "idle left" sprite for the witch, resulting in the witch facing right instead of left when speaking to the friend

- [ ] Weird blank squares happening over the friend at the start of the inside scene, and if the player moves to the left of the crystal ball table (I removed the collisions on the table to test that). Also happens sometimes when the player emotes...
- [ ] Logo screen?

- [x] Title screen
- [x] Define controls
- [x] The friend is not animated when walking left in the first scene
- [x] Clean up the background of the first scene
- [x] Why are the gems on the right moving when we interact with them?
