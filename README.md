# arojam
A small game for AroJam in March 2022
Made with GB Studio

## TODO :
- [ ] The friend is not animated when walking left in the first scene
- [ ] Clean up the background of the first scene
- [ ] Title screen?
- [ ] Why are the gems on the right moving when we interact with them?
- [ ] The card disappeared after I interact with it
- [ ] Weird blank squares happening over the friend at the start of the inside scene, and if the player moves to the left of the crystal ball table (I removed the collisions on the table to test that). Also happens sometimes when the player emotes...
- [ ] Could we have a visual hint on the counter that the player can interact with the witch through the counter? A mat of something?
- [ ] Logo screen?
